AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository
AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository
Creates an association between an approval rule template and a speciﬁed repository. Then, the next 
time a pull request is created in the repository where the destination reference (if speciﬁed) matches 
the destination reference (branch) for the pull request, an approval rule that matches the template 
conditions is automatically created for that pull request. If no destination references are speciﬁed in the 
template, an approval rule that matches the template contents is created for all pull requests in that 
repository.

CreateApprovalRuleTemplate
CreateApprovalRuleTemplate
Creates a template for approval rules that can then be associated with one or more repositories in your 
AWS account. When you associate a template with a repository, AWS CodeCommit creates an approval 
rule that matches the conditions of the template for all pull requests that meet the conditions of the 
template. For more information, see AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository (p. 7).
Request Syntax
{ 
   "approvalRuleTemplateContent ": "string", 
   "approvalRuleTemplateDescription ": "string", 
   "approvalRuleTemplateName ": "string"
}
Request Parameters
For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common 
Parameters (p. 441).
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
approvalRuleTemplateContent (p. 35)
The content of the approval rule that is created on pull requests in associated repositories. If you 
specify one or more destination references (branches), approval rules are created in an associated 
repository only if their destination references (branches) match those speciﬁed in the template.
Note
When you create the content of the approval rule template, you can specify approvers in an 
approval pool in one of two ways:
•CodeCommitApprovers: This option only requires an AWS account and a resource. It can 
be used for both IAM users and federated access users whose name matches the provided 
resource name. This is a very powerful option that oﬀers a great deal of ﬂexibility. For 
example, if you specify the AWS account 123456789012  and Mary_Major, all of the 
following are counted as approvals coming from that user:
•An IAM user in the account (arn:aws:iam::123456789012 :user/Mary_Major)
•A federated user identiﬁed in IAM as Mary_Major 
(arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major)
This option does not recognize an active session of someone assuming 
the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of Mary_Major
(arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/Mary_Major) unless you 
include a wildcard (*Mary_Major).
•Fully qualiﬁed ARN : This option allows you to specify the fully qualiﬁed Amazon 
Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.
For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see IAM Identiﬁers  in the
IAM User Guide .

CreatePullRequestApprovalRule
CreatePullRequestApprovalRule
Creates an approval rule for a pull request.
Request Syntax
{ 
   "approvalRuleContent ": "string", 
   "approvalRuleName ": "string", 
   "pullRequestId ": "string"
}
Request Parameters
For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common 
Parameters (p. 441).
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
approvalRuleContent (p. 59)
The content of the approval rule, including the number of approvals needed and the structure of an 
approval pool deﬁned for approvals, if any. For more information about approval pools, see the AWS 
CodeCommit User Guide.
Note
When you create the content of the approval rule, you can specify approvers in an approval 
pool in one of two ways:
•CodeCommitApprovers: This option only requires an AWS account and a resource. It can 
be used for both IAM users and federated access users whose name matches the provided 
resource name. This is a very powerful option that oﬀers a great deal of ﬂexibility. For 
example, if you specify the AWS account 123456789012  and Mary_Major, all of the 
following would be counted as approvals coming from that user:
•An IAM user in the account (arn:aws:iam::123456789012 :user/Mary_Major)
•A federated user identiﬁed in IAM as Mary_Major 
(arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major)
This option does not recognize an active session of someone assuming 
the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of Mary_Major
(arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/Mary_Major) unless you 
include a wildcard (*Mary_Major).
•Fully qualiﬁed ARN : This option allows you to specify the fully qualiﬁed Amazon 
Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or role.
For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see IAM Identiﬁers  in the
IAM User Guide .

CreateUnreferencedMergeCommit
CreateUnreferencedMergeCommit
Creates an unreferenced commit that represents the result of merging two branches using a speciﬁed 
merge strategy. This can help you determine the outcome of a potential merge. This API cannot be used 
with the fast-forward merge strategy because that strategy does not create a merge commit.
Note
This unreferenced merge commit can only be accessed using the GetCommit API or through 
git commands such as git fetch. To retrieve this commit, you must specify its commit ID or 
otherwise reference it.

UpdatePullRequestApprovalRuleContent
UpdatePullRequestApprovalRuleContent
Updates the structure of an approval rule created speciﬁcally for a pull request. For example, you can 
change the number of required approvers and the approval pool for approvers.
Request Syntax
{ 
   "approvalRuleName ": "string", 
   "existingRuleContentSha256 ": "string", 
   "newRuleContent ": "string", 
   "pullRequestId ": "string"
}
Request Parameters
For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see Common 
Parameters (p. 441).
The request accepts the following data in JSON format.
approvalRuleName (p. 343)
The name of the approval rule you want to update.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 100.
Required: Yes
existingRuleContentSha256 (p. 343)
The SHA-256 hash signature for the content of the approval rule. You can retrieve this information 
by using GetPullRequest (p. 187).
Type: String
Required: No
newRuleContent (p. 343)
The updated content for the approval rule.
Note
When you update the content of the approval rule, you can specify approvers in an approval 
pool in one of two ways:
•CodeCommitApprovers: This option only requires an AWS account and a resource. It can 
be used for both IAM users and federated access users whose name matches the provided 
resource name. This is a very powerful option that oﬀers a great deal of ﬂexibility. For 
example, if you specify the AWS account 123456789012  and Mary_Major, all of the 
following are counted as approvals coming from that user:
•An IAM user in the account (arn:aws:iam::123456789012 :user/Mary_Major)
•A federated user identiﬁed in IAM as Mary_Major
