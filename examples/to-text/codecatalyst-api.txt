CreateAccessToken
CreateAccessToken
Creates a personal access token (PAT) for the current user. A personal access token (PAT) is similar to 
a password. It is associated with your user identity for use across all spaces and projects in Amazon 
CodeCatalyst. You use PATs to access CodeCatalyst from resources that include integrated development 
environments (IDEs) and Git-based source repositories. PATs represent you in Amazon CodeCatalyst and 
you can manage them in your user settings.For more information, see Managing personal access tokens 
in Amazon CodeCatalyst.

CreateDevEnvironment
CreateDevEnvironment
Creates a Dev Environment in Amazon CodeCatalyst, a cloud-based development environment that you 
can use to quickly work on the code stored in the source repositories of your project.
Note
When created in the Amazon CodeCatalyst console, by default a Dev Environment is conﬁgured 
to have a 2 core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 16GB of persistent storage. None of these defaults 
apply to a Dev Environment created programmatically.
