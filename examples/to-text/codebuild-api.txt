xiAWS CodeBuild API Reference
Welcome
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs 
unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, 
manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most 
popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can 
also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales 
automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more 
information about CodeBuild, see the  AWS CodeBuild User Guide.

CreateWebhook
CreateWebhook
For an existing AWS CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket 
repository, enables AWS CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is 
pushed to the repository.
Important
If you enable webhooks for an AWS CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step 
in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered 
through webhooks, and one through CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you 
are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you 
disable webhooks in AWS CodeBuild. In the AWS CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For 
more information, see step 5 in Change a Build Project's Settings.

UpdateProjectVisibility
UpdateProjectVisibility
Changes the public visibility for a project. The project's build results, logs, and artifacts are available to 
the general public. For more information, see Public build projects in the  AWS CodeBuild User Guide.
Important
The following should be kept in mind when making your projects public:
•All of a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including builds that were run when the 
project was private, are available to the general public.
•All build logs and artifacts are available to the public. Environment variables, source code, and 
other sensitive information may have been output to the build logs and artifacts. You must be 
careful about what information is output to the build logs. Some best practice are:
•Do not store sensitive values in environment variables. We recommend that you use an 
Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive 
values.
•Follow Best practices for using webhooks in the  AWS CodeBuild User Guide to limit which 
entities can trigger a build, and do not store the buildspec in the project itself, to ensure 
that your webhooks are as secure as possible.
•A malicious user can use public builds to distribute malicious artifacts. We recommend that 
you review all pull requests to verify that the pull request is a legitimate change. We also 
recommend that you validate any artifacts with their checksums to make sure that the correct 
artifacts are being downloaded.

Note
To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must have the s3:PutBucketAcl
permission. This permission allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for the 
bucket.
This property can be one of the following values:
NONE
The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.
READ_ONLY
The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership 
of the objects.
FULL
The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the 
following criteria:
•If the bucket is conﬁgured with the Bucket owner preferred setting, the bucket owner owns 
the objects. The uploading account will have object access as speciﬁed by the bucket's policy.
•Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.

ProjectArtifacts
Information about the build output artifacts for the build project.
Contents
Note
In the following list, the required parameters are described ﬁrst.
type
The type of build output artifact. Valid values include:
•CODEPIPELINE : The build project has build output generated through CodePipeline.
Note
The CODEPIPELINE  type is not supported for secondaryArtifacts .
•NO_ARTIFACTS : The build project does not produce any build output.
•S3: The build project stores build output in Amazon S3.
Type: String
Valid Values: CODEPIPELINE | S3 | NO_ARTIFACTS
Required: Yes
artifactIdentiﬁer
An identiﬁer for this artifact deﬁnition.
Type: String
Required: No
bucketOwnerAccess
Speciﬁes the bucket owner's access for objects that another account uploads to their Amazon S3 
bucket. By default, only the account that uploads the objects to the bucket has access to these 
objects. This property allows you to give the bucket owner access to these objects.
Note
To use this property, your CodeBuild service role must have the s3:PutBucketAcl
permission. This permission allows CodeBuild to modify the access control list for the 
bucket.
This property can be one of the following values:
NONE
The bucket owner does not have access to the objects. This is the default.
READ_ONLY
The bucket owner has read-only access to the objects. The uploading account retains ownership 
of the objects.
FULL
The bucket owner has full access to the objects. Object ownership is determined by the 
following criteria:
•If the bucket is conﬁgured with the Bucket owner preferred setting, the bucket owner owns 
the objects. The uploading account will have object access as speciﬁed by the bucket's policy.
API Version 2016-10-06
222AWS CodeBuild API Reference
Contents
•Otherwise, the uploading account retains ownership of the objects.
For more information about Amazon S3 object ownership, see Controlling ownership of 
uploaded objects using S3 Object Ownership in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
Type: String
Valid Values: NONE | READ_ONLY | FULL
Required: No
encryptionDisabled

artifacts type is Amazon S3. If this is set with another artifacts type, an invalidInputException is 
thrown.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
location
Information about the build output artifact location:
•If type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this value if speciﬁed. This is because 
CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild.
•If type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if speciﬁed, because no build output is 
produced.
•If type  is set to S3, this is the name of the output bucket.
Type: String
Required: No
name
Along with path  and namespaceType , the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the 
output artifact:
•If type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this value if speciﬁed. This is because 
CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
•If type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if speciﬁed, because no build output is 
produced.
•If type  is set to S3, this is the name of the output artifact object. If you set the name to be a 
forward slash ("/"), the artifact is stored in the root of the output bucket.
For example:
•If path  is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType  is set to BUILD_ID , and name  is set to
MyArtifact.zip , then the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/
MyArtifact.zip .
•If path is empty, namespaceType  is set to NONE , and name  is set to "/", the output artifact is 
stored in the root of the output bucket.
•If path  is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType  is set to BUILD_ID , and name  is set to "/", the 
output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID> .
Type: String

namespaceType
Along with path  and name, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to determine the name and 
location to store the output artifact:
•If type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this value if speciﬁed. This is because 
CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
•If type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if speciﬁed, because no build output is 
produced.
•If type  is set to S3, valid values include:
•BUILD_ID : Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact.
•NONE: Do not include the build ID. This is the default if namespaceType  is not speciﬁed.
For example, if path  is set to MyArtifacts , namespaceType  is set to BUILD_ID , and name
is set to MyArtifact.zip , the output artifact is stored in MyArtifacts/<build-ID>/
MyArtifact.zip .
Type: String
Valid Values: NONE | BUILD_ID
Required: No
overrideArtifactName
If this ﬂag is set, a name speciﬁed in the buildspec ﬁle overrides the artifact name. The name 
speciﬁed in a buildspec ﬁle is calculated at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For 
example, you can append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always unique.
Type: Boolean
Required: No
packaging
The type of build output artifact to create:
•If type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this value if speciﬁed. This is because 
CodePipeline manages its build output artifacts instead of AWS CodeBuild.
•If type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if speciﬁed, because no build output is 
produced.
•If type  is set to S3, valid values include:
•NONE: AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a folder that contains the build output. This 
is the default if packaging  is not speciﬁed.
•ZIP: AWS CodeBuild creates in the output bucket a ZIP ﬁle that contains the build output.
Type: String
Valid Values: NONE | ZIP
Required: No
path
Along with namespaceType  and name, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild uses to name and store the 
output artifact:
•If type  is set to CODEPIPELINE , CodePipeline ignores this value if speciﬁed. This is because 
CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.
•If type  is set to NO_ARTIFACTS , this value is ignored if speciﬁed, because no build output is 
produced.

Required: No
modes
An array of strings that specify the local cache modes. You can use one or more local cache modes at 
the same time. This is only used for LOCAL cache types.
Possible values are:
LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE
Caches Git metadata for primary and secondary sources. After the cache is created, subsequent 
builds pull only the change between commits. This mode is a good choice for projects with a 
clean working directory and a source that is a large Git repository. If you choose this option and 
your project does not use a Git repository (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket), the option is 
ignored.
LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE
Caches existing Docker layers. This mode is a good choice for projects that build or pull large 
Docker images. It can prevent the performance issues caused by pulling large Docker images 
down from the network.
Note
•You can use a Docker layer cache in the Linux environment only.
•The privileged  ﬂag must be set so that your project has the required Docker 
permissions.
•You should consider the security implications before you use a Docker layer cache.

LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE
Caches directories you specify in the buildspec ﬁle. This mode is a good choice if your build 
scenario is not suited to one of the other three local cache modes. If you use a custom cache:
•Only directories can be speciﬁed for caching. You cannot specify individual ﬁles.
•Symlinks are used to reference cached directories.
•Cached directories are linked to your build before it downloads its project sources. Cached 
items are overridden if a source item has the same name. Directories are speciﬁed using cache 
paths in the buildspec ﬁle.
Type: Array of strings
Valid Values: LOCAL_DOCKER_LAYER_CACHE | LOCAL_SOURCE_CACHE | LOCAL_CUSTOM_CACHE
Required: No

To be able to report the build status to the source provider, the user associated with the source 
provider must have write access to the repo. If the user does not have write access, the build status 
cannot be updated. For more information, see Source provider access in the  AWS CodeBuild User 
Guide .
The status of a build triggered by a webhook is always reported to your source provider.
If your project's builds are triggered by a webhook, you must push a new commit to the repo for a

Common Parameters
The following list contains the parameters that all actions use for signing Signature Version 4 requests 
with a query string. Any action-speciﬁc parameters are listed in the topic for that action. For more 
information about Signature Version 4, see Signing AWS API requests in the IAM User Guide .
Action
The action to be performed.
Type: string
Required: Yes
Version
The API version that the request is written for, expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Type: string
Required: Yes
X-Amz-Algorithm
The hash algorithm that you used to create the request signature.
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query string 
instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Valid Values: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Credential
The credential scope value, which is a string that includes your access key, the date, the region you 
are targeting, the service you are requesting, and a termination string ("aws4_request"). The value is 
expressed in the following format: access_key /YYYYMMDD/region /service/aws4_request.
For more information, see Create a signed AWS API request in the IAM User Guide .
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query string 
instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Date
The date that is used to create the signature. The format must be ISO 8601 basic format 
(YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'). For example, the following date time is a valid X-Amz-Date value:
20120325T120000Z .
Condition: X-Amz-Date is optional for all requests; it can be used to override the date used for 
signing requests. If the Date header is speciﬁed in the ISO 8601 basic format, X-Amz-Date is not 
required. When X-Amz-Date is used, it always overrides the value of the Date header. For more 
information, see Elements of an AWS API request signature in the IAM User Guide .
API Version 2016-10-06
307AWS CodeBuild API Reference
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Security-Token
