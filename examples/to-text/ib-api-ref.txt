ImportVmImage
ImportVmImage
When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization environment, that process creates 
a set of one or more disk container ﬁles that act as snapshots of your VM’s environment, settings, and 
data. The Amazon EC2 API ImportImage action uses those ﬁles to import your VM and create an AMI. To 
import using the AWS CLI command, see import-image
You can reference the task ID from the VM import to pull in the AMI that the import created as the base 
image for your Image Builder recipe.
Request Syntax

AdditionalInstanceConﬁguration
AdditionalInstanceConﬁguration
In addition to your infrastructure conﬁguration, these settings provide an extra layer of control over your 
build instances. You can also specify commands to run on launch for all of your build instances.
Image Builder does not automatically install the Systems Manager agent on Windows instances. If your 
base image includes the Systems Manager agent, then the AMI that you create will also include the 
agent. For Linux instances, if the base image does not already include the Systems Manager agent, Image 
Builder installs it. For Linux instances where Image Builder installs the Systems Manager agent, you can 
choose whether to keep it for the AMI that you create.
Contents
systemsManagerAgent
Contains settings for the Systems Manager agent on your build instance.
Type: SystemsManagerAgent (p. 312) object
Required: No
userDataOverride
Use this property to provide commands or a command script to run when you launch your build 
instance.
The userDataOverride property replaces any commands that Image Builder might have added to 
ensure that Systems Manager is installed on your Linux build instance. If you override the user data, 
make sure that you add commands to install Systems Manager, if it is not pre-installed on your base 
image.
Note
The user data is always base 64 encoded. For example, the following commands are 
encoded as IyEvYmluL2Jhc2gKbWtkaXIgLXAgL3Zhci9iYi8KdG91Y2ggL3Zhci$ :
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /var/bb/

version
The semantic version of the component.

zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder 
automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.

the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, 
such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.
Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the ﬂexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify 
the most recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components for your

CvssScore
CvssScore
Amazon Inspector generates a risk score for each ﬁnding. This score helps you to prioritize ﬁndings,

the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides. For more information about severity levels, see
Severity levels for Amazon Inspector ﬁndings in the Amazon Inspector User Guide .

version

The semantic version has four nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign

Assignment:  For the ﬁrst three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including 
zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder 
automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.
Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for 
the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, 
such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.
Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the ﬂexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify 
the most recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components for your 
recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of the ﬁrst wildcard must 
also be wildcards.

nodes are either left oﬀ entirely, or they are speciﬁed as wildcards, for example: x.x.x.
2.Version ARNs have only the ﬁrst three nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>
3.Build version ARNs have all four nodes, and point to a speciﬁc build for a speciﬁc version 
of an object.

version
Details for a speciﬁc version of an Image Builder image. This version follows the semantic version 
syntax.
Note
The semantic version has four nodes: <major>.<minor>.<patch>/<build>. You can assign 
values for the ﬁrst three, and can ﬁlter on all of them.
Assignment:  For the ﬁrst three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including 
zero, with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder 
automatically assigns the build number to the fourth node.
Patterns: You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for 
the nodes that you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, 
such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as 2021.01.01.

Filtering:  With semantic versioning, you have the ﬂexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify 
the most recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components for your 
recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to the right of the ﬁrst wildcard must 
also be wildcards.

Common Parameters
The following list contains the parameters that all actions use for signing Signature Version 4 requests 
with a query string. Any action-speciﬁc parameters are listed in the topic for that action. For more 
information about Signature Version 4, see Signing AWS API requests in the IAM User Guide .
Action
The action to be performed.
Type: string
Required: Yes
Version
The API version that the request is written for, expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Type: string
Required: Yes
X-Amz-Algorithm
The hash algorithm that you used to create the request signature.
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query string 
instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Valid Values: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Credential
The credential scope value, which is a string that includes your access key, the date, the region you 
are targeting, the service you are requesting, and a termination string ("aws4_request"). The value is 
expressed in the following format: access_key /YYYYMMDD/region /service/aws4_request.
For more information, see Create a signed AWS API request in the IAM User Guide .
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query string 
instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Date
The date that is used to create the signature. The format must be ISO 8601 basic format 
(YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'). For example, the following date time is a valid X-Amz-Date value:
20120325T120000Z .
Condition: X-Amz-Date is optional for all requests; it can be used to override the date used for 
signing requests. If the Date header is speciﬁed in the ISO 8601 basic format, X-Amz-Date is not 
required. When X-Amz-Date is used, it always overrides the value of the Date header. For more 
information, see Elements of an AWS API request signature in the IAM User Guide .

security token.
Type: string
Required: Conditional
X-Amz-Signature
Speciﬁes the hex-encoded signature that was calculated from the string to sign and the derived 
signing key.
Condition: Specify this parameter when you include authentication information in a query string 
instead of in the HTTP authorization header.
Type: string
